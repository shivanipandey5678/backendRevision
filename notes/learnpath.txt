What is the path Module?
The path module helps you work with file and folder paths. It makes sure your paths are correct, no matter what operating system you’re using (like Windows or macOS).

Key Functions
path.join(...)

Combines parts of a path into one complete path. It makes sure the slashes are correct.
Example: path.join('folder', 'file.txt') → 'folder/file.txt'
path.resolve(...)

Turns a path into an absolute path (full path) based on where your program is running.
Example: path.resolve('folder', 'file.txt') might output something like /Users/YourName/folder/file.txt.
path.basename(path)

Gets just the file name from a path.
Example: path.basename('/folder/file.txt') → 'file.txt'
path.dirname(path)

Gets the folder part of a path.
Example: path.dirname('/folder/file.txt') → '/folder'
path.extname(path)

Gets the file extension (like .txt or .jpg).
Example: path.extname('file.txt') → '.txt'
path.normalize(path)

Cleans up a path by fixing any extra slashes or dots.
Example: path.normalize('/folder//file.txt') → '/folder/file.txt'
