Difference between res.setHeader() and res.writeHead():

1. res.setHeader():
   - Adds one header at a time.
   - Think of it as writing different parts of a letter separately:
     - First, you write the address.
     - Then, the date.
     - Then, the sender's info.

   Example:
   res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain"); // Sets content type
   res.setHeader("X-Powered-By", "Node.js");    // Adds another header

2. res.writeHead():
   - Adds all headers together in one go.
   - It's like writing the entire letter in one step:
     - Address, date, and sender's info written all at once.

   Example:
   res.writeHead(200, { 
     "Content-Type": "text/plain", 
     "X-Powered-By": "Node.js"
   });

Summary:
- res.setHeader(): Like filling out a form one field at a time.
- res.writeHead(): Like filling out the entire form in one go.
