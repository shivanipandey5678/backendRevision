**Axios Overview**

**What is Axios?**
Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. It helps you send and receive data from a server, which is essential for interacting with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

**Purpose**

- **Promise-Based:** Axios uses JavaScript Promises, which allow you to handle asynchronous operations smoothly. Promises help you work with operations that take time to complete, such as fetching data from a server.

- **HTTP Client:** Axios simplifies making HTTP requests, such as GET (retrieve data) and POST (send data), and handling the responses from these requests.

**Installation**

To use Axios in your project, you need to install it via npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install axios


//get requests
axios.get("https://api.example.com/data")
.then((res=>{
    console.log(res.data)
})
.catch(err=>{
    console.log(err)
})

//POST Request: Send data to create a new resource.
axios.post('https://api.example.com/data',{
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
})
.then(res=>{
    console.log(response.data);
})
 .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });



//PUT Request: Update an existing resource.
//DELETE Request: Remove a resource.
